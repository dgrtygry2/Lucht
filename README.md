# Lucht
The user interface for BasinOS.

What is BasinOS?
BasinOS is an open-source OS that aims to be a OS that is simple and easy to use. It uses Lucht GUI as its UI. This OS is not UNIX, It is forked from ReactOS but unlike ReactOS, This OS does not aim to be a open-source Windows clone, This OS aims to be a general purpose OS that is command line and uses a TUI and doesn't run windows programs but batch files! Its UI is batch file and It functions on soley batch files! The forked version of ReactOS is a stable build of ReactOS that is modified to be stripped of its GUI and soley run on cli. This is the basis for BasinOS. 

This repo contains the code for Lucht GUI.

To build BasinOS, a build tool will be provided where it will auto build Lucht and BasinOS and create a ISO. Currently BasinOS is in alpha similar to how ReactOS is in alpha. But this OS does not aim to run Windows NT apps. The biggest priority is designing Lucht and fitting it all into BasinOS. As of now, Nothing is here except the README. 

Current TODOS:
Work on stripping down ReactOS and rebranding our custom ReactOS stable build to BasinOS.
Develop a "Batch file file system" (BFFS)
Work on build tool once everything is put together and working properly.
Design Lucht GUI.
